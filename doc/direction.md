# Minetest Direction Document



## 0. Preface

### 0.1. Introduction

This document attempts to set out Minetest's philosophy, aims, and objectives.

Please note that Minetest is developed by a community, and not everyone in the community
holds the same views as to what Minetest should be.

### 0.2. Definitions

* `Minetest` is the game engine.
* `Minetest Game` is the default game which comes with the engine.
* The `Minetest Project` refers to the combination of the above, the development team, and supporting tools.

### 0.3. Other documents

## 1. Mission Statement

Minetest provides both a game engine, which allows the creation of voxel games using Lua, and
a content distribution platform. Players can connect to servers with their own gameplay, and
easily install content through the Minetest client. The goal is to provide an easy to learn and use,
but still powerful system which allows to easily and rapidly create, extend and modify voxel games.

## 2. Aims

* **Stability and performance**, especially on older devices.
* **Keep the engine as universal as possible**. It's worth comparing everything that goes
  into the engine for how well it suits a gravitation-less space game without ground surface.
  If everything is either disableable or suitable for such, then it gives much more freedom
  for people to experiment and create interesting things, even in ground-based worlds.
* **Keep the engine lightweight**. Support a large amount of gameplay by pushing code and functionality out to Lua,
  rather than having a complex core. Keeping the core as small as possible makes it
  easier to test and more flexible.
* **Make polishing easy**. It shouldn't be made unnecessarily hard to make polished content
  even while most content isnâ€™t polished.
* **Prefer simplicity**. Try to be simple in both API and features.
* **Self-contained**. Avoids relying on third party behaviour. For example, there is no
  central account system and the serverlist isn't actually needed to play online.
* **Multi-platform**. Features should be designed with all platforms in mind

## 3. Target Games

It's important to limit the scope of the engine to something which is managable.

* Games where players are in 1st or 3rd person.
* Games with roughly meter sized cubes.
