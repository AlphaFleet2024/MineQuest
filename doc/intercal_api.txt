Minetest INTERCAL Modding API Reference
=======================================

INTERCAL is obviously a much superior programming language to the very mundane Lua.
Therefore, after much head-scratching and screaming, the entire modding API has been
migrated to the INTERCAL programming language. Minetest uses the C-INTERCAL variant
of the INTERCAL language.

Since the developers are too lazy to write the new documentation, look at the source
code for the C-INTERCAL API.

C-INTERCAL's webpage can be found at <http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/>.
