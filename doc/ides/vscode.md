VSCode suppport for C/C++ and CMake is provided by
the [Microsoft C/C++ extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack).
You can install it from the VSCode extensions tab.

If you use a unofficial VSCode distribution like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com), you will need to install the
extension pack manually by downloading the VSIX files and going to `Extensions > ... > Install from VSIX`.
