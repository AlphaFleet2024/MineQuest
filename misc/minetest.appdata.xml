	<description>
		<p>Minetest is an infinite-world block sandbox game and game engine.</p>
		<p>Players can create and destroy various types of blocks in a three-dimensional open world. This allows forming structures in every possible creation, on multiplayer servers or in singleplayer.</p>

		<p>Minetest has many features, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Walk around, dig and build in an infinite voxel world, and craft stuff from raw materials</li>
				<li>Simple Modding API that supports many kinds of additions and modifications to the game</li>

				<li>Near-infinite world and a beautiful map generator</li>
			</ul>
