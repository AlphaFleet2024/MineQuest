			<ul>
				<li>Walk around, dig and build in an infinite voxel world, and craft stuff from raw materials to help you along the way.</li>
				<li>Simple Modding API that supports many kinds of additions and modifications to the game.</li>
				<li>Multiplayer support for tens of players, via servers hosted by users.</li>
				<li>Voxel based lighting with gameplay consequences (light caves and buildings with torches)</li>
				<li>Almost infinite world and a beautiful map generator</li>
			</ul>
